# Floating Point Arithmetic: Addition and Subtraction with Finite Precision

## 1. Why Floating Point?
Computers cannot represent most real numbers exactly.  
Instead, they use a **finite binary approximation** called *floating point representation*.  

Example:
- The decimal number `0.1` **cannot be represented exactly** in binary floating point. (Why? Try to determine its binary representation on paper!)
- What the computer stores is sometimes just a nearby approximation.

---

## 2. Finite Precision
A floating point number has:
- **Sign bit** (positive/negative),
- **Exponent** (scale factor),
- **Mantissa / significand** (precision digits).

Since the mantissa has limited bits (e.g. 23 bits in `float`, 52 in `double`), **only finitely many numbers can be stored**.  
This leads to *rounding errors*.

---

## 3. What Can Happen with Addition/Subtraction?

### 3.1. Rounding Errors
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float x = 0.1f + 0.2f;
    printf("%.10f\n", x);
    return 0;
}

Output might be:

0.3000000119

ðŸ‘‰ The result is close to 0.3, but not exact.
3.2. Loss of Significance (Cancellation)

Subtracting nearly equal numbers can cause most significant digits to cancel out, leaving only error.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double a = 1.0000001;
    double b = 1.0000000;
    double diff = a - b;
    printf("Difference: %.20f\n", diff);
    return 0;
}

Expected: 0.0000001
Actual: something like 0.00000010000000000364
(here less bits were used to represent 0.000001, as a lot went to represent a 1.)
ðŸ‘‰ The relative error is large, even if the number looks small.
3.3. Adding Numbers of Very Different Magnitudes

When adding a very small number to a very large one, the small one can disappear.-->summations may not converge anymore!

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double big = 1e16;
    double small = 1.0;
    double sum = big + small;
    printf("Sum: %.0f\n", sum);
    return 0;
}

Output:

10000000000000000

ðŸ‘‰ The +1 is lost due to limited precision.
//Joke: in petrol station: -How much is a drop of petrol? -Oh, it's free -Drop it full for me please!

4. How to Work with Floating Point Safely

    Never compare floats directly (if (x == y) is dangerous).
    Instead, compare with a tolerance:

    if (fabs(x - y) < 1e-9) { /* treat as equal */ }

    Rearrange computations to avoid subtracting nearly equal numbers!

    Use higher precision (double instead of float) if accuracy is important.

    Be aware of rounding: results may differ slightly across compilers or platforms.

5. Key Takeaways

    Floating point numbers are approximations.

    Adding/subtracting can produce rounding errors and loss of significance.

    Always design programs with these limitations in mind.
